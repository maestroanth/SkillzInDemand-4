CourseTro Lesson 11 Deployment

AOT = Ahead of Time Compilation

ng build

creates a folder names dist (has some big files)

ng build --prod (getting some erros with this)

then ftp eventhing in dist folder up to a server

if root doesn't match (which it will most likely not do this)

ng build --prod --base-href /whatever/

if you want to publish project onto github:

ng build --base-href https://maestroanth.github.io/<repository-name>/

and then

ngh

if it says successfully published, then it should be live at URL!

(I'm not going to publish this app because of the "adult material" ;P )
