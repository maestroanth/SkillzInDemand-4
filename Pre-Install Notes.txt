The git clone quickstart was far easier than the Angular-CLI install

The Angular-CLI couldn't parse the package.JSON file because of some funny unexpected 'string' error, and I could not find anything wrong with that file through an IDE or anything!
However, I just deleted that whole file text which circumvented that error (however it didn't create the project in the right directory, so I had to copy and paste it into the skillz folder)
and it seemed to work after that!
